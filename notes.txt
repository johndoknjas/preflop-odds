Could get some speedup by not redoing the compare.py work to calculate the rank for a new besthand
(from the loop in run_sim).

Add a pytest file that runs tests for like 100 hands somehow (random gametype, random num opps, random player hand, etc),
and then test that the equity is within some points of a percent of data you get from online calcs.
    - https://caniwin.com/texasholdem/oddscalculator/
    - Can use the percent error it gives immediately (~100,000 sims) for what you should get after 100k
      sims, compared to the online calc's "true" value after a million or 2. Though note that they say
      their odds are within a 95% error margin, so be slightly less strict than their bounds on your tests.

After running the sims for the three gametypes, post the combined txt files on github.

Update the readme to explain how to use the program, and the three txt files with results you'll have included.
Mention running with `pypy` for best performance.

Maybe try to use your Card class in compare.py as well, rather than lists/tuples.
