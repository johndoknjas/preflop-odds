Try using pypy (or cython) and see if that gives good speedup.

Could get some speedup by not redoing the compare.py work to calculate the rank for a new besthand
(from the loop in run_sim).

Add a pytest file that runs tests for like 100 hands somehow (random gametype, random num opps, random player hand, etc),
and then test that the equity is within like 0.5% of data you get from online calcs.

After running the sims for the three gametypes, post the combined txt files on github.

Update the readme to explain how to use the program, and the three txt files with results you'll have included.

Add support for Omaha sims. Will require modifying `getBestFrom7` to take min and max vals for #cards
that can be used from the player hand and the community cards.
    - On this note, would be good to use your Hand and Card classes in compare.py as well. Try
      to replace the lists with them.
